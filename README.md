## 1. Introduction

Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common type of genetic variation among individuals. Detecting SNPs efficiently is vital in personalized medicine, diagnostics, and evolutionary biology. This project demonstrates how to detect SNPs using probe binding mismatch analysis via Python â€” a simple yet powerful in silico method.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Simulate and detect SNPs using probe mismatch logic.  
- Implement a Python-based tool that compares a probeâ€™s ability to bind with reference vs. SNP-containing sequences.  
- Identify mismatch points and evaluate probe efficiency.

---

## 3. Background

Probes are short oligonucleotide sequences used in hybridization-based techniques such as qPCR or microarrays. A SNP within a probe-binding region can reduce hybridization efficiency or cause binding failure. This feature is useful in allele-specific probe-based SNP detection.

---

## 4. Tools and Technologies

- Python 3.10+  
- Biopython â€“ for sequence handling  
- difflib â€“ for sequence comparison  
- pandas â€“ (optional) for tabular data output  

### Installation:
```bash
pip install biopython pandas

## 6. Results and Discussion

### Reference Sequence Binding:
The probe matched perfectly at a specific position.

### Variant Sequence Result:
- Mismatch found at **position 12**
  - Reference base: `C`  
  - Variant base: `T`

This mismatch in the middle of the probe may significantly reduce hybridization efficiency, potentially leading to SNP detection failure.

---

## 7. Applications

- SNP genotyping and diagnostics  
- qPCR probe design validation  
- Allele-specific hybridization testing  
- Educational bioinformatics simulations

---

## 8. Limitations

- Analyzes one SNP and one probe at a time  
- Does not include thermodynamic modeling (e.g., Tm shifts)  
- Only supports exact match/mismatch logic

---

## 9. Future Improvements

- Integrate Tm (melting temperature) calculation  
- Enable batch analysis for multiple probes/sequences  
- Add GUI using Tkinter or Streamlit  
- Parse real-world VCF files for population-scale SNPs

---

## 10. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a simple and effective method to detect SNPs based on probe binding mismatches using Python. It provides a foundation for more advanced tools that incorporate thermodynamic analysis and high-throughput genomics.
