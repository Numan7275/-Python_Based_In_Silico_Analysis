## 1. Introduction

Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common type of genetic variation among individuals. Detecting SNPs efficiently is vital in personalized medicine, diagnostics, and evolutionary biology. This project demonstrates how to detect SNPs using probe binding mismatch analysis via Python â€” a simple yet powerful in silico method.

## 2. Objectives

- Simulate and detect SNPs using probe mismatch logic.  
- Implement a Python-based tool that compares a probeâ€™s ability to bind with reference vs. SNP-containing sequences.  
- Identify mismatch points and evaluate probe efficiency.

---

## 3. Background

Probes are short oligonucleotide sequences used in hybridization-based techniques such as qPCR or microarrays. A SNP within a probe-binding region can reduce hybridization efficiency or cause binding failure. This feature is useful in allele-specific probe-based SNP detection.
